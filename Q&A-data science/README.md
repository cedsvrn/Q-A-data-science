## Standardisation vs Normalisation
FIXME

## Collaborative filtering vs Content based
Goal : recommend a product P to a user A

- Collaborative filtering (CF) : Try to  find similar user to A and recommend what those users consumes.
Cons : Cold start (need user-item interactions), algorithms not standards.
- Content based (CB) :  Regroup products and recommend products close to P. 
Pros : Classification problem.
